**Rock-melt interactions in upper mantle xenoliths**

My honors thesis at Macalester investigated how melt-rock interactions shape the lithospheric mantle. I started this project at the [2024 MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP)](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/) under the guidance of [Dr. Nicole Xike Nie](https://eaps.mit.edu/people/faculty/nicole-xike-nie/).

I studied mantle xenoliths from two intraplate volcanic settings: Tariat, Mongolia, and Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico. My goal was to understand how melt composition, interaction timescales, and temperature influence the mineral and chemical evolution of the lithospheric mantle. I used a combination of petrography, micro-XRF, SEM-WDS, and EPMA to analyze six xenoliths from these two regions.

Diffusion modeling of Ca and Al profiles constrains melt-rock interaction timescales to thousands of years in Tariat and just decades in Kilbourne Hole. These contrasting histories also show up in mineral chemistry: Tariat samples are enriched in Ca/Al with high-Mg# olivine, while Kilbourne Hole samples display melt depletion trends like high Mg# in pyroxenes and elevated Cr# in spinel. Cooling rates differ as wellâ€”Tariat samples cooled slowly over tens of thousands of years, while Kilbourne Hole samples cooled over just a few years.
