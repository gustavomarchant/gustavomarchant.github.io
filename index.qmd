## About me

I am geology student largely interested in geochemistry of mantle melts. I am interested in the origin and cycling of volatile elements and isotopic signatures in melts. I am looking for ways to intersect geochemistry, petrology, and statistics.

## Personal

I was born in Santiago, Chile but I grew up in Padre Hurtado, a town in the outskirts of the city. When I was 17, I received a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/about) scholarship to attend UWC Robert Bosch in Freiburg, Germany. After finishing the International Baccalaureate diploma, I moved to Saint Paul, MN to start my undergrad at Macalester College.

I love baking and cooking for my friends. I keep my own recipe book with recipes that I inherited from my great-grandmother. As a member of many international communities, I love trying foreign food.
