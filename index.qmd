::: {#intro-heading}

My name is Gustavo A. Marchant Allende ([pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/gustavomarchantallende1)). The pronouns that I use are [he/him/his](https://pronouns.org/he-him).

I am a PhD student at Purdue University working with [Kelsey Prissel](https://kelseyprissel.weebly.com) at the [Purdue Petrology Suite](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/petrology/). My research interests include igneous processes in the Earth's mantle and volcanism on the Moon.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. When I was 17, I received a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/about) scholarship to attend UWC Robert Bosch in Freiburg, Germany. I love baking and cooking for my friends! I keep my own recipe book with recipes that I inherited from my great-grandmother. I am a fan of urban biking, lifting, and hiking.
